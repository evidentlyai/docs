This is relevant when you logging Reports to the Platform. Tags help you associate the Report with a specific model / prompt version, period, etc.

## Add timestamp

Each Report run has a single timestamp. By default, Evidently will assign the `datetime.now()` using the Report computation time based on the user time zone.

You can also add your own timestamp. Pass it to the run method:

```python
from datetime import datetime

my_eval_4 = report.run(eval_data_1,
                       eval_data_2,
                       timestamp=datetime(2024, 1, 29))
```

Since you can assign arbitrary timestamps, you can log Reports asynchronously or with a delay (for example, after you receive ground truth) and assign it to the specific period.

## Add tags and metadata

You can include `tags` and `metadata` to Reports. This is useful for search and data filtering. By adding **Tags**, you can then visualize data only from a specific subset of your snapshots on a monitoring Panel.

Examples of when to use tags include:

* Identify a specific evaluation run or experiment (by model version, prompt version, test scenario, etc).

* Identify app or model status: production/shadow, champion/challenger, or A/B model versions.

* Identify the Report by geography, use case, segment, role, etc. 

* Identify the reference dataset window (for example, if you compare distribution drift week-by-week and month-by-month and log two different Reports).

* You want to tag individual Reports that have a special role, e.g., a datasheet card, a model card, etc.

**Custom tags**. Pass any custom Tags as a list:

```python
report = Report([
    ClassificationPreset()
],
tags=["groupA", "shadow"])
```

**Custom metadata**. Pass metadata as a Python dictionary in key:value pairs:

```python
report = Report([
    ClassificationPreset()
],
metadata = {
	"deployment": "shadow",
	"status": "production",
	}
```

**Default metadata**. Use built-in metadata fields `model_id`, `reference_id`, `batch_size`, `dataset_id`:

```python
report = Report([
    ClassificationPreset()
],
    model_id=model_id,
	reference_id=reference_id,
	batch_size=batch_size,
	dataset_id=dataset_id
)
```

**Add Tags to existing Reports.**. You can add Tags to a previously generated Report or Test Suite:

```python
data_summary_report.tags=["training_data"]
```
