Read the overview of the approach [here](/docs/platform/monitoring_overview).

Batch monitoring relies on the core evaluation API of the Evidently Python library. Check the [detailed guide](/docs/library/evaluations_overview).

## Simple Example

<Tip>
  You must first connect to [Evidently Cloud](/docs/setup/cloud) and [create a Project](/docs/platform/projects_manage).
</Tip>

To get the dataset stats for a single batch and upload to the workspace:

```python
eval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(
    pd.DataFrame(source_df),
    data_definition=DataDefinition()
)

report = Report([
    DatasetStats()
])

my_eval = report.run(eval_data, None)
ws.add_run(project.id, my_eval, include_data=False)
```

## Workflow

The complete workflow looks as the following.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the metrics">
    Define an [Evidently Report](/docs/library/report) with optional [Test](/docs/library/tests) conditions to define the evals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the evals">
    You must independently execute Reports on a chosen cadence. Consider tools like Airflow. You can send Reports from different steps in your pipeline. For example:

    * first, send data quality, data drift and prediction drift checks

    * after you get the delayed labels, send a ML quality checks results.

    You can backdate your Reports with a custom timestamp.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload to the platform">
    Choose to store raw inferences or only upload the metric summaries. [How to upload / delete results](/docs/platform/evals_api).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Dashboard">
    Set up a Dashboard to track results over time: using pre-built Tabs or configure your own choice of monitoring Panels. Check the [Dashboard guide](/docs/platform/dashboard_overview).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure alerts">
    Set up alerts on Metric values or Test failures. Check the section on [Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Running Tests vs Reports**. Structuring your evaluations as Tests - as opposed to monitoring lots of metrics at once - can help reduce alert fatigue and simplify configuration when evaluating multiple conditions at once. For example, you can quickly verify that all columns in the input data are within a defined min-max range.
