## What is a monitoring Panel?

A monitoring Panel is an individual plot or counter on the Monitoring Dashboard.Â 

* You can add multiple Panels and organize them by **Tabs**. You can customize Panel type, values shown, titles and legends.

* When adding a Panel, you choose a **Test** or **Metric** with the specific value ("metric result") inside it. Evidently pulls corresponding value(s) from all Reports in the Project and plots them on the Panel.

* You can use **Tags** to filter data from specific Reports. For example, you can plot the accuracy of Model A and Model B next to each other. To achieve this, [add relevant Tags](/docs/library/tags_metadata) to the Report.

  **How to add Panels**. This page explains the Panel types. Check the next section on [adding Panels](/docs/platform/dashboard_add_panels).

**Panel types.** There are 3 main panel types:

* **Metric panels** plot individual values from inside Reports.

* **Test panels** show pass/fail Test outcomes in time.

* **Distribution panels** plot distributions over time.

## Metric Panels

Metric Panels (`DashboardPanel`) show individual values from inside the Reports in time.

For example, if you capture Data Summary Reports (include mean, max, min, etc., for each column) or Data Drift Reports (include the share of drifting columns and per-column drift score), you can plot any of these values in time.

**Panel time resolution** depends on Report frequency. For instance, if you log Data Drift Reports daily, you can plot the share of drifting features with daily granularity. You can also open the source Report to see feature distributions on a specific day.

### Counter

Class `DashboardPanelCounter`.

Shows a value with supporting text or text alone. Perfect for dashboard titles.

### Plot

Class `DashboardPanelPlot`. Shows individual values as bar, line, scatter plot, or histogram.

  <Card title="Line chart" img="/images/dashboard//panel_line_plot_example.png">
    `PlotType.LINE` shows values over time from multiple Reports.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bar chart" img="/images/dashboard//panel_bar_plot_example.png">
    `PlotType.BAR` shows values over time from multiple Report.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Scatter plot" img="/images/dashboard//panel_scatter_plot_example.png">
    `PlotType.SCATTER` shows values over time from multiple Reports.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Histogram" img="/images/dashboard//panel_hist_example.png">
    `PlotType.HISTOGRAM` shows the frequency of individual values across Reports.
  </Card>

## Test Panels

Test Panels show the Test results.

As you run the same Tests repeatedly, you can visualize the pass/fail outcomes or result counts. You choose which Test results to include.

Test Panels only work with Test Suites: you must add Tests to the Metrics inside your Report to be able to render these panels.

### Test counter

Class `DashboardPanelTestSuiteCounter`. Shows a counter of Tests with specified status.

### Test plot

Class `DashboardPanelTestSuite`.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Detailed plot" img="/images/dashboard/panel_tests_detailed_hover_example.png">
    `TestSuitePanelType.DETAILED`. Individual Test results are visible
  </Card>

  <Card title="Aggregated plot" img="/images/dashboard/panel_tests_aggregated_hover_example.png">
    `TestSuitePanelType.AGGREGATE`. Only the total number of Tests by status is visible.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Distribution Panel

Class `DashboardPanelDistribution`. Shows a distribution of values over time.

For example, if you capture Text Evals or Data Summary that include histograms for categorical values, you can plot how the frequency of categories changes.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Stacked" img="/images/dashboard/panel_dist_stacked_2-min.png">
    `barmode="stack"`: stacked bar chart shows **absolute** counts in a single bar.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Grouped" img="/images/dashboard/panel_dist_group_2-min.png">
    `barmode="group"`: grouped bar chart shows **absolute** counts in separate bars.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Overlay" img="/images/dashboard/panel_dist_overlay-min.png">
    `barmode="overlay"`: overlay bar chart shows overlaying **absolute** counts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Relative" img="/images/dashboard/panel_dist_relative-min.png">
    `barmode="relative"`: relative bar chart shows stacked **relative** frequency.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **What is the difference between a Distribution panel and a Histogram?** A histogram plot (`DashboardPanelPlot` with`PlotType.HISTOGRAM`) shows the distribution of the selected values from all Reports. Each source Report contains a **single value** (e.g., a "mean value"). A Distribution Panel (`DashboardPanelDistribution`) shows how a distribution changes over time. Each source Report contains a **histogram** (e.g. frequency of different categories).
