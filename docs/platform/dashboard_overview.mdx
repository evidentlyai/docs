## What is a Dashboard?

A Dashboard provides a clear view of your AI application performance. You can use it:

- to track evaluation results across multiple expriments;
- to track live production quality over time.

Each Project has its own Dashboard. It's empty at first.

To populate it, you need to run an evaluation and **save at least one Report** to the Project. You can then choose values from Reports to plot.

## **Dashboard Panels**

A Panel is a visual element in the Dashboard that displays specified values in a single widget. Panels can be counters, line plots, bar plots, etc.

You can customize your Dashboard by adding Panels:

- **Using Python API**. Define dashboard as code.
- **Through the UI**. Add Panels directly from the interface. (Cloud and Enterprise only).

To create a Panel, you need to specify:

- **Value**. Choose individual metric results to plot.
- **Parameters** like title, panel type, size.
- **Tags** (optional). You can filter and visualize specific data subsets. To enable this, you must first add Tags (e.g. a model version) to Reports when you run an evaluation.

## From Dashboard to Reports

By clicking on any individual value on the Dashboard, you can open the associated Report and source Dataset for further debugging.

You can logically organize Panels within the same Dashboard into different Tabs.
