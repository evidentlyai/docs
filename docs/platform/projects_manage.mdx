To work with Projects via API, first [connect to Evidently Cloud](../setup/cloud) or your [local workspace](../setup/self-hosting).

## Create a Project

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    To create a Project inside a workspace `ws` and Organization with an `org_id`:

    ```
    project = ws.create_project("My test project", org_id="YOUR_ORG_ID")
    project.description = "My project description"
    project.save()
    ```

    In self-hosted open-source installation, you do not need to pass the Org ID. To create a Project:

    ```
    project = ws.create_project("My test project")
    project.description = "My project description"
    project.save()
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="UI">
    * **Create a Project.** Click on the “plus” sign on the home page, set a Project name and description.

    * **Edit a Project**. To change the Project name or description, hover on the existing Project, click "edit" and make the changes.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Connect to a Project

<Tip>
  **Project ID**. You can see the Project ID above the monitoring Dashboard inside your Project.
</Tip>

To connect to an existing Project from Python, use the `get_project` method.

```python
project = ws.get_project("PROJECT_ID")
```

## Working with a Project

### Save changes

After making any changes to the Project (like editing description or adding monitoring Panels), always use the `save()` command:

```python
project.save()
```

### Browse Projects

You can see all available Projects on the monitoring homepage, or request a list programmatically. To get a list of all Projects in a workspace `ws`, use:

```python
ws.list_projects()
```

To find a specific Project by its name, use the `search_project` method:

```python
ws.search_project("project_name")
```

### \[DANGER] Delete Project

<Warning>
  Deleting a Project deletes all the data inside it.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    To delete the Project:

    ```
    # ws.delete_project("PROJECT ID")
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="UI">
    Hover on the existing Project and click "delete".
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Project parameters

Each Project has the following parameters.
