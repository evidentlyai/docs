# Evals API

## Upload existing snapshots

Typically you compute and upload Reports at the same time. If you already have a snapshot (e.g., you previously saved a Report as a JSON snapshot locally), you can load it load and send it to your Project.&#x20;

```python
ws.add_run(project.id, snapshot.load("data_drift_snapshot.json"))
```

Note that you must previously save the Report [as a JSON snapshot](/docs/library/output_formats) (not export as JSON or HTML).

## Delete snapshots

To delete individual snapshots in the Workspace `ws`, pass the Project ID and snapshot ID. You can see the snapshot ID on the Report page.&#x20;

```python
ws.delete_snapshot(project_id, snapshot_id)
```

You can also delete Reports from the UI.
