Evidently Platform helps you manage AI quality across the AI system lifecycle, from pre-deployment testing to production monitoring. It supports evaluations of open-ended LLM outputs, predictive tasks like classification, and complex workflows like AI agents.

## Key features

<Info>
  Evidently Platform has a lightweight open-source version for evaluation tracking and monitoring, and a Cloud/Enterprise version with extra features. [Check feature availability.](/faq/oss_vs_cloud)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Evaluations">
    Run evaluations locally with the Evidently Python library or no-code on the platform. Use 100+ built-in evals and templates. Track, compare, and debug experiments.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Datasets">
    Manage and organize testing and production datasets. Store them on the platform paired with relevant evaluations. Collaborate to curate test cases.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Synthetic data">
    Generate synthetic data for RAG, Q&A, or other use cases. Design test scenarios, edge cases, and adversarial inputs for safety evaluations and stress-testing.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Regression testing">
     Combine evaluations in conditional Test Suites with Pass/Fail outcomes. Set alerts for failed Tests. Track results over time using the built-in dashboard.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monitoring">
    Run evaluations for live systems in batch or real-time. Track results on a dashboard and connect back to raw data as needed. Set alerts for violations.

  <Tab title="Tracing">
    Instrument your AI application to collect inputs, outputs and any intermediate steps. Automatically get a ready-made structured dataset for analysis.

While many workflows can be run no-code directly on the platform, you’ll often need programmatic access – for example, to upload datasets or run local experimental evaluations. In these cases, you can use the Evidently Python library to interact with the Evidently Cloud API.

To collect input-outputs from your production AI systems, you'd also need to install Tracely, a lightweight tool based on OpenTelemetry.
