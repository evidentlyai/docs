## What is a Project?

A **Project** helps you organize data and evaluations for a specific use case. You can view all your Projects on the home page.

Each Project:

* Stores its own **datasets**, **reports**, and **traces**.

* Has a dedicated **dashboard** and **alerting** rules.

* Has a **unique ID** for connecting via the **Python API** to send data, edit dashboards, and manage configurations. You can also manage everything through the UI.

What to put in one Project? You can structure projects to suit your workflow. Here are some ideas:

* **By Application or Model.** Create individual Projects for each LLM app or ML model.

* **By App Component.** For complex systems like AI agents, set up Projects for specific components, such as evaluating intent identification independently of other features.

* **By Test Scenario.** Use separate Projects for distinct test scenarios, like isolating safety or adversarial datasets from other evaluations.

* **By Phase.** Manage different development stages of the same app with Projects dedicated to experimentation/testing and production monitoring.

* **By Use Case**:. Group data and evaluations for multiple ML models in one Project, organizing them with tags (e.g., "version," "location").
