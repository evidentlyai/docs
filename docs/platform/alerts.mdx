To enable alerts, open the Project and navigate to the "Alerts" in the left menu. You must set:

* A notification channel.

* An alert condition.

## Notification channels

You can choose between the following options:

* **Email**. Add email addresses to send alerts to.

* **Slack**. Add a Slack webhook.

* **Discord**. Add a Discord webhook.

## Alert conditions

### Failed tests

If you use Tests (conditional checks) in your Project, you can tie alerting to the failed Tests in a Test Suite. Toggle this option on the Alerts page. Evidently will set an alert to the defined channel if any of the Tests fail.

<Tip>
  **How to avoid alert fatigue?** Use the `is_critical` parameter to mark non-critical Test as Warnings. Setting it to `False` prevent alerts for those checks even if they fail.
</Tip>

### Custom conditions

You can also set alerts on individual Metric values. For example, you can generate Alerts when the share of drifting features is above a certain threshold.

Click on the plus sign below the “Add new Metric alert” and follow the prompts to set an alert condition.
