Evidently helps evaluate, test, and monitor data and AI-powered systems.

- Evidently is an **open-source Python library** with over 25 million downloads. It provides 100\+ evaluation metrics, a declarative testing API, and a lightweight visual interface to explore the results.
- **Evidently Cloud platform** offers a complete toolkit for AI testing and observability. It includes tracing, synthetic data generation, dataset management, eval orchestration, alerting and a no-code interface for domain experts to collaborate on AI quality.

Our goal is to help teams build and maintain reliable, high-performing AI products: from predictive ML models to complex LLM-powered systems.
