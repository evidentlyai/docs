Synthetic input generation allows you to create test questions from descriptions and examples. This helps expand test coverage and evaluate how your AI system handles different types of queries. You can use this to:

* Generate test questions for RAG systems without predefined answers.
* Create adversarial inputs by describing specific edge cases.
* Generate questions tailored to specific user personas for more targeted testing.

## Create synthetic inputs

### 1. Create a Project

In the Evidently UI, start a new Project or open an existing one.

* Navigate to “Datasets” in the left menu.
* Click “Generate” and select the “Generate from examples” option.

### 2. Describe the scenario

Define what kind of inputs you need by providing a brief description of the task. and choose how many inputs to generate. For example, if you’re building a travel assistant, you could enter:

* Description: "Questions a person can ask when planning a trip"
* Example input: "What can I do in Paris in a day?"

This guides the system in generating relevant and diverse inputs.

You can also use a more detailed prompt.

## 3. Review the results

The system will generate a list of input questions based on your description. You can preview and refine the generated dataset.

You can:

* Use “More like this” to generate additional variations.
* Drop questions that don’t fit your needs.
* Manually edit or rephrase questions.

## 4. Save and use the dataset

Once finalized, save the dataset. You can download it as a CSV file or access it via the Python API using the dataset ID.
