Evidently Cloud lets you generate synthetic test inputs (and outputs) to evaluate your AI system. You can use it for:
* **Experiments**. Create test data to see how your LLM app handles it.
* **Regression testing**. Validate changes before deployment.
* **Adversarial testing**. Check how your system handles tricky or unexpected inputs.

Once you generate the data, you can run it through your AI system and evaluate the results using the Evidently Cloud or Evidently Python library as usual.
