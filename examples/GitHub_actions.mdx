You can use Evidently together with GitHub Actions to automatically test the outputs of your LLM agent or application - as part of every code push or pull request.

## How the integration work:

- You define a test dataset of inputs (e.g. test prompts with or without reference answers). You can store it as a file, or save the dataset at Evidently Cloud callable by Dataset ID.
- Run your LLM system or agent against those inputs inside CI.
- Evidently automatically evaluates the outputs using the user-specified config (which defines the Evidently descriptors, tests and Report composition), including methods like:
  - LLM judges (e.g., tone, helpfulness, correctness)
  - Custom Python functions
  - Dataset-level metrics like classification quality
- If any test fails, the CI job fails.
- You get a detailed test report with pass/fail status and metrics.

Results are stored locally or pushed to Evidently Cloud for deeper review and tracking.

The final result is CI-native testing for your LLM behavior - so you can safely tweak prompts, models, or logic without breaking things silently.
